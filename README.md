👋 Hi, I’m @Big-Taco

👀 I’m passionate about full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.
🌱 My journey into tech started when I founded Remora, a crypto app that democratized access to professional traders’ live position data in real time. I saw an opportunity to leverage untapped data with underutilized technology, but I didn’t yet have the coding skills. With a minimal budget, I had to dive in — learning how to debug and troubleshoot alongside my developers. That exposure gave me my first taste of software development.
📱 From there, I began teaching myself Flutter, working with other developers to build mobile apps on Google Firebase. This was where I started coding as a hobbyist, slowly gaining hands-on skills while collaborating on real products.
🚀 Today, I’m building TNVisaPro — a platform born from my own TN Visa journey (first as an applicant, then helping others as a side hustle). It brings together years of experience in consulting and immigration support with the technical skills I’ve developed to date.

⚡ Fun fact: I spent almost a decade in Fortune 500 consulting before turning coding into a hobby and eventually building full-stack AI apps.
