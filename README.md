# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam (Big-Taco)

I'm a founder, builder, and self-taught engineer with a background in operations, automation, and software tooling. I enjoy solving complex systems problems and building practical software that helps people move faster and make better decisions.

I have also been a crypto enthusiast since 2017, mostly exploring products, tools, and market cycles as a user and builder. This curiosity has shaped a lot of my thinking around systems, automation, security, and how people interact with technology.
